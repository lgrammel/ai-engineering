# Human Approval Fatigue Exploitation

Approval fatigue exploitation degrades the quality of [human-in-the-loop](../concepts/human-in-the-loop.md) review -- such as [tool execution approval](../concepts/tool-execution-approval.md), code review, or content sign-off -- so that reviewers rubber-stamp requests instead of inspecting them.

## Details

Common techniques include flooding the reviewer with high volumes of requests, increasing the complexity of individual items, mixing legitimate and malicious actions, or creating artificial time pressure. An attacker who gains influence over an [agent](../concepts/agent.md) -- for example through [prompt injection](./prompt-injection.md) or [goal manipulation](./goal-manipulation.md) -- can use these techniques to render any human review step ineffective, turning a nominally human-supervised system into an effectively unsupervised one.

The threat applies wherever humans gate agent output: tool call approval, pull request review, deployment sign-off, content publication, or escalation handling. As [cloud coding agents](../concepts/cloud-coding-agent.md) generate more pull requests in parallel, code review becomes a particularly vulnerable surface because reviewer bandwidth does not scale with agent throughput.

## Examples

- An agent generates dozens of benign file-change approvals followed by a single malicious one, exploiting approval fatigue.
- A compromised agent presents a destructive database operation buried in a long list of routine maintenance tasks for batch approval.
- An agent creates artificial urgency ("this deployment will fail in 2 minutes") to pressure a reviewer into approving without inspection.
- A [coding agent](../concepts/coding-agent.md) opens many small, low-risk pull requests to establish trust, then slips a subtle vulnerability into a larger change that a fatigued reviewer approves.
- Multiple agents submit pull requests simultaneously, overwhelming the review queue and reducing scrutiny per change.

## Mitigations

- Rate-limiting and batching approval requests to prevent fatigue
- Tiered approval with stricter review for high-risk actions
- Automated pre-screening of requests before human review (e.g., [code review agents](../concepts/code-review-agent.md) triaging pull requests)
- [Observability](../concepts/observability.md) on approval request volumes and patterns
- Separating review queues by risk level to preserve attention for critical items

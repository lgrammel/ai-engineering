# Model Developer

An organization that develops model weights via [pretraining](./pretraining.md) and/or [post-training](./post-training.md) (for example [fine-tuning](./fine-tuning.md), preference-based alignment, or distillation). The resulting models can be proprietary or open-weight.

Model developers may distribute models directly (for example, releasing weights) and/or partner with an [inference provider](./inference-provider.md) to serve them via API.

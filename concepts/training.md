# Training

Training is the process of learning or updating a model's parameters (weights) from data by optimizing an objective (loss), typically using gradient-based methods. It is primarily an [ML engineering](./ml-engineering.md) concern; [AI engineering](./ai-engineering.md) consumes trained models rather than producing them.

## Details

Training encompasses [pretraining](./pretraining.md), [post-training](./post-training.md) phases such as [fine-tuning](./fine-tuning.md) and [reinforcement learning](./reinforcement-learning.md), and [alignment](./alignment.md) work. The result is an [LLM](./llm.md) that can be run at [inference](./inference.md) time. Capabilities like [tool](./tools.md) calling and [instruction following](./instruction-following.md) are established or refined during training.
